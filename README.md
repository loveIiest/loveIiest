<p><b>whisper to interact,</b> I am usually off-tab. I am typically doing college work.<br>
  I am almost always sitting with <a href="https://github.com/metaIIic" rel="nofollow">@metaIIic&ZeroWidthSpace;</a>. If I am, please INT with caution.<br>
  I kin Reed Richards, and self-ship with Sue Storm and Victor Vondoom.  <br>
  I kinda don't like doubles, but I don't make it a huge deal. Just don't compete.<br>
  
 
  I am mainly into Marvel and JJBA. Fantstic Four and Battle Tendency specfically. <br>
I will pretty much speak to anyone, but I would prefer minors limit interaction.<br>
DNI if you involve yourself in drama frequently and that's all you care about.
