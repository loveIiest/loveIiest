<p><b>whisper to interact,</b> I am usually off-tab. I am almost always sitting with <a href="https://github.com/metaIIic" rel="nofollow">@metaIIic&ZeroWidthSpace;</a>. 
  I don't mind speaking to people, but if I don't reply, I am usually off-tab or I just don't wish to speak at that time.<br>
  
 
  I am mainly into Marvel and JJBA. Fantstic Four and Battle Tendency specfically. <br>
I like DoomReedSue and CaeJoseQ. With that being said, do not force ships onto me.<br>
  Genuinely DNI if you ignore a canonically MLW in favor for your 'superior yaoi'. 
</p>
  
<p><b>dni.</b> minors, TT/DNT/TD lol, mental illness fakers, proship/heavy antiship. <br>
  <b> I hide freely,</b> just please be normal and don't be a jerk. I only hide if you are rude. <br>
  Don't involve me in stupid drama, I could not possibly care less about that garbage.</p>
